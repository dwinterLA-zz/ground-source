text: I work with GROUNDSOURCE because they deliver — the best market insight, the
  most direct relationships, and, ultimately, the best deal.  And they do it with
  integrity.  No bait-and-switch, no sweetheart deals, no one’s best interest over
  mine.  For over a decade, I have trusted them on deals from 1,000 sq/ft to 100,000
  sq/ft and everything in between — no one works harder or knows more.  These are
  professionals worthy of your time, and more importantly, your TRUST.
