text: I have been very fortunate to have found commercial broker, Chris Keller, whose
  expertise in commercial real estate in my opinion is unmatched.  I have worked with
  Chris for a number of years and found that I can rely on him, and most importantly
  trust him.  Even after a lease is signed, when an issue arises, I can call him and
  he is as responsive to my requests after the lease is signed as he was prior to
  the signing.  His careful evaluation of the totality of the transaction is exceptional.  But,
  what I have found to set him apart from other brokers are his strong negotiation
  skills and ability to protect the interests of the tenant on even the most incidental
  terms of the agreement.  I would not place my trust in any other broker and strongly
  recommend Chris Keller in the commercial setting.
