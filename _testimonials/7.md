text: 'As a Director of Administration of law firms for over 25 years, both international
  and regional, I have worked with a number of real estate brokers. Not only did I
  enjoy working with Chris, I found his expertise, relationships in the industry,
  and professionalism preeminent. For example, six months after executing our lease,
  he managed to move our scheduled free rent to another point in the lease term, without
  a penalty to the firm.Â  '
